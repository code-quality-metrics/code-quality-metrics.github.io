## Node principles

- Event driven
  Programming paradigm in which the program execution is determined by events. Each function executes an event. Node provides the event listener that awaits for calls.
- Non-blocking I/O
  When Node.js needs to perform an I/O operation instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back. This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections.
- Single process
  Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node sends requests in an event loop and goes on to handle the next request in the call stack.
- Small core
  Node has a simple and small core leaving the bulk of features to npm packages.
- High [modularity](modularity.md)
  The Node.js way, in fact, involves extreme levels of reusability. Applications are composed of a high number of small, well-focused dependencies.
